## Welcome!! üëã
I'm a full stack web developer ready to solve future challenges and keep learning about everything I can! I already work with technologies like Javascript, React, Express, Node and MongoDB, and currently learning Typescript. My background as an audiovisual technician and a technology enthusiast, gave me a motivation to learn about developing and see coding as a technical puzzle to solve!
